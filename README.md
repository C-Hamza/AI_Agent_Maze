# AI_Agent_Maze
This project implements an AI agent that navigates a maze using BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First Search, and A* Search. It compares their time and space complexity, path efficiency, and overall performance. Ideal for AI pathfinding, robotics, and game development, it highlights how different search strategies impact navigation efficiency.
